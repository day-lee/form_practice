## 🗝️ Key Features

## 🤓 What I learned
- Managing **`object-type states`**, **`initial state constants`**, and **`functional updates`** for cleaner and more maintainable code.
- Using **`React Router`** for SPAs (Single Page Applications).
- Accessibility design; including button hover color contrast, using **`alt`** for img tags, **`Enter`** key submission, and **`autofocus`**
